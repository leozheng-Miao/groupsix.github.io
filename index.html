                Hello, everyone. I'm Zheng Miao and a member of Team Six. My student ID is 3860862. I am a RMIT student from China. This is the first year of my bachelor's degree in Information Technology in RMIT. I hope this will be a good start for me to study abroad. Unfortunately, due to the covid-19 virus, I had to stay in China to attend classes through canvas. I have many hobbies, however which I have to mention most is table tennis. I used to be a professional table tennis player, the unique charm of this sport deeply attracted me. Now I am no longer a table tennis player, but an it student. At the same time, I also like to watch other types of sports, such as the Champions League and NBA. My favorite teams are Barcelona and Team Los Angeles Lakers. As for my passion for it, I started when I was a child. When I was a child, I was curious that an iron box and a screen can do so many things. It wasn't until I grew up that I realized that there was something called code behind the creation of these applications and displays. It's really interesting, as if code is everything. Later, I chose it major. This time, I don't want to be just a spectator, I want to be a creator, learning and making progress in the world of information technology. My IT experience can only be said to have just reached the level of a beginner. I have used java language to create train ticket management system, and used Python to create some small games and web crawlers. I hope I can get in touch with bigger it projects through my future study.
            </p>
              <p>
                  From my three tests, I can see that I have the characteristics of an adventurer. I can easily connect with other people's emotions in the team, and help team members establish a harmonious and good cooperation atmosphere. In fact, I usually do things in my own way, which has a good side and a bad side. The good side is that creative thinking and enthusiastic emotions can make the team more active and improve work efficiency. The bad side is that when encountering difficulties, emotions may fluctuate and affect other players. I need to pay attention to this all the time, even if I think it's almost impossible for me, as a member of the team, I have to be responsible to my team members all the time.

                      My name is Fengke Zhan. My Student ID is 3860870. I come from Shenzhen, a city lies in south of China which is next to Hongkong. My major is Information Technology and it's my first year in RMIT. Honestly I have never been to overseas yet and my English is not that well. It's hard for me to understand some internet slang that my classmates or teachers saying and sometime I am really confusing what they are talking about. But learning about different culture is interesting for me. I also have many hobbies like traveling, playing basketball(though not good at it) and playing video games, espiceally FPS games such as CSGO or APEX. My first FPS game is CS1.5, I play it when I was 6. However, my favorite video game is Destiny2 which I have played for more than 1000 hours. Except for games, I also like reading some science fictions espiceally about the universe. It makes me can't help to think about the secrets of the universe and I believe that IT can help us figure out more secrets about the univers. I start to interest in IT since I was 6. When I first time access to video games, I started to wonder what IT can do more. When I grow up, I read a book about Bill Gates. As we all known, Microsoft exactly benefit people's lives. I also want to use IT to convenient daily lives and make more fun.

                  <p>
                      According to the test results, I am a logician and a tactile learner. This means that I am good at analysis and abstract thinking. I like to imagine and open-minded, easy to accept new ideas. But it's easy for me to fall into my own logic and get frustrated. And I learn by touching and doing. Practice can help me learn faster. I prefer to take things apart and put them together. I don't have the courage to go beyond accepted practice. These results point out my strengths and weaknesses. I should be careful of my shortcomings and use my strengths to help my teammates and my team.

                      My name is Xing Shiqiao. My student ID is 3860951. I come from Hohhot, Inner Mongolia. My hometown is in the north of China. My major is information technology. This is my first year in computer science and technology. To be honest, I haven't been to Australia and have been taking online classes. I am very interested in learning with students from different cultural backgrounds! I like traveling very much. I have been to more than 80 cities in China. I like to experience different customs. I also look forward to traveling to different countries overseas in the coming days. Besides traveling, I like playing music very much. I can play piano and saxophone. Music allows me to relax and make a lot of friends who have the same music hobby. I was very interested in it when I was very young. When I was a child, I saw others typing on the keyboard to achieve different computer functions. I felt that the computer was very magical and could help us solve many difficulties in our daily life.

                  <p>
                      About my tests result. It turns out that I'm an auditory learner, and it's easier for me to store information by sounding than by writing. For example, sitting in a place where I can hear and reading new words aloud can make me more efficient. Entrepreneurial traits make me influence the environment around me, but because of the personality type of risk-taking behavior, I usually make wrong decisions because of emotion.My creativity is 49 points. I'm not very creative. Because I have some leadership, although creativity is not strong, but can play a better role in team leadership, to find creative teammates, so that we can learn from each other to build a perfect team.

                      My name is ZhiHong Deng, you can call me jim. My student ID is 3860863. I am from Zhuhai, China, a very beautiful coastal city. I am currently studying for the Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT. I don't have many hobbies, there are only three main hobbies, playing guitar, fitness and photography. I have been training in the gym for three years. I am embarrassed to release photos of my muscles here. If you are also interested in fitness, we can go to the gym to work out together when I can go to Melbourne to study. You can contact me through my WeChat or email. Of course, we can also play the guitar or take pictures together. The place I am most interested in IT is that I can write a web page or program by myself and add details according to my preferences, which is very fulfilling. I had this idea when I first came into contact with computer games when I was in primary school. The official website and client of the game at that time were not as user-friendly as they are now, and it was not smooth to use, so I wanted to improve it at that time.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      The test result shows that I am a person who lacks creativity, but fortunately, I am a patient person. I prefer to learn visually. My personality is neither extroverted nor introverted. I prefer to observe before doing things. When making decisions, I will not be too impulsive or too sensible. I am relatively decisive in doing things. Combining the above results, when I encounter a difficult problem when working in a team, I may not be able to solve it immediately but I will definitely solve it, because as long as I choose one thing, I will stick to it. Because I lack creativity, I prefer creative teammates to activate the team.

                      My name is Gu Hao, I am from China, a city is called Foshan. I am so glad to come to RMIT university, my major course is Information Technology .I have huge interests in IT(although my level is just a bit.) My favorite hobby is sport which include basketball and workout in the gym. I have had studied in REW in 2019 for a period which was a very wonderful experience. I love teachers’ way in education, makes me gained much more knowledge about Australia, is quite a powerful nation in tourism and education and other parts associated with many other nations. And I love Australia so much. I was getting in touch with computer when I am in secondary school. The IT world attracted me in many fields, I was wondering how could a machine so powerful could connect with all the planet. That was the first sight which I am so interested in IT course . And a few yeas ago I went to a power plant that I have seen so many huge machines were controlling just by a computer ,and then make power to thousands and thousands families to use in life. What an unbelievable story, I will not trust if I had seen it by myself. Thus that I have made a plan to how to handle with this my dream course.

                      I am an international student from China. And my student ID is 3816123. There are great differences between Chinese and Western cultures. My study experiences before University are in China. However, I want to get higher education overseas. So that, I improve my English skill by studying IELTS. Therefore, I can speak Chinese and English. Now I expect to study computer language. In my childhood, when I watched science fiction film the screen shows the future technology had attracted my attention. In my past, I was modelling and understanding of systems programming, network engineering knowledge and information, but also the first time concerned about the new generation of technology products release. I self-taught assembled my first desktop computer, installed the windows system.In my opinion, I was attracted by information technology when I was a child. I want to get more knowledge about IT, in order to change my life style. When I was young, I was very lucky to visit the science and technology exhibition of Hong Kong University of science and technology. Since then, I think it is a very cool subject.

                      These three results let me know the positioning in a team. The Architect personalities reflect that I have a thirst for knowledge, design and implement plans in my field. I am both a visionary idealist and a mean realist. The two seem to be contradictory, but they do not affect my pursuit of my goals. I think a lot when I'm alone. It's a personality that yearns for truth. The results of learning test shows that I should do something with physical, aural, and logical jobs. I need to do it myself, pay close attention to everything around me, analyse and think, and finally come to a logical result. Finally, the result of Self Direct Search print that thinkers rather than doers, abstract thinking ability, thirst for knowledge, willing to use the brain, good thinking, not willing to do. Like to work independently and creatively. Knowledgeable, knowledgeable, not good at leading others. Thinking about problems rationally, doing things like precision, like logical analysis and reasoning, constantly explore the unknown field.

                    It can be seen from the ideal job of each member that most members are more interested in artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence is a subject that makes computer simulate some thinking process and intelligent behavior of human (such as learning, reasoning, thinking, planning, etc.), mainly including the principle of realizing intelligence by computer, making computer similar to human brain intelligence, so that computer can realize higher level application. Moreover, in terms of the current computer environment, artificial intelligence is bound to become the mainstream of science and technology in the future. It looks more like the person who can occupy a place in the field of artificial intelligence has better employment prospects. Other members are more interested in the development of front-end web. Front end development is the process of creating web pages or app and other front-end interfaces to present to users. Through HTML, CSS and JavaScript and various technologies, frameworks and solutions derived from them, the user interface interaction of Internet products can be realized.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is obviously unreasonable to compare AI with front-end development. Artificial intelligence will involve computer science, psychology, philosophy and linguistics. It can be said that almost all disciplines of natural science and social science have gone far beyond the scope of computer science. The relationship between artificial intelligence and thinking science is the relationship between practice and theory. Artificial intelligence is at the technical application level of thinking science, and is an application branch of it. The front-end development evolved from web page production, and the name has obvious characteristics of the times. In the evolution of the Internet, web page production is the product of the Web1.0 era. The main content of the early website is static, mainly pictures and text, and the behavior of users using the website is mainly browsing. In short, AI requires a wider range of skills than front-end development. Front end development focuses on the use of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and HTTP and other network protocols; AI programming skills are more advanced, and need to have a high degree of creativity.

          <h3>Cybersecurity</h3>
          <h3>What does it to do?</h3>
          <p>Cybersecurity means that the software, hardware and the data contained in the network system are protected from damage, change, leakage and intrusion due to sudden or malicious reasons. The network system can operate normally and continuously, and the network service will not be interrupted. Cybersecurity refers to the organization and collection of resources, processes and structures, which are used to protect cyberspace and cyberspace supported systems from events inconsistent with the property rights of defectors (Craigen, Dan; Diakun-Thibault, Nadia; Purse, Randy, 2014)  </p>
          <p>In order to make the network can smoothly implement the function of resource sharing, it is necessary to ensure the normal operation of network hardware and software, as well as the security of data information interaction. For example, the personal information (such as bank account number and login password) transmitted on the network is not found by others, which is the requirement of users for the confidentiality of the information transmitted on the network. At present, cybersecurity is not only related to privacy and property security, but also directly related to personal safety. Looking forward to the new ecological construction of digital security, we need to understand the security problems from a new perspective, jump out of the traditional concept of attack and defense, promote the linkage of the government, enterprises and users on the basis of cooperation, and jointly enhance the awareness of protection to prevent the fracture of a link in the chain. In the era of digital economy, security is no longer the problem of a single enterprise or industry. To weave the "protection net" of cybersecurity and build a comprehensive security protection system requires the cooperation of various institutions and fields. </p>
          <p>Due to the rapid development of computer technology, network information has become an important guarantee for the harmonious development of society. Cybersecurity is mainly to prevent man-made attacks from all over the world, such as computer viruses, data tampering, information leakage, theft and so on. At the same time, the network entity has to be tested by electromagnetic radiation, fire, earthquake and other natural factors. The Futurist Stephen Steele (2009) pointed out: "the network system... Is not just information, but network culture. Multi-level coordinated cyber-attacks will be able to carry out large-scale (national security system), medium-sized (local power grid) and small-scale (car launched) destruction at the same time. Eichensehr, Kristen E (2017) mentioned that the threat of cybersecurity (1) Destroy infected computer networks used by transnational criminal groups ("botnet cancellation"). (2) Fix software vulnerabilities that can be used for criminal, spying and offensive operations ("zero-day vulnerability"). (3) Attribute network intrusion to state sponsored attackers. (4) Protect private systems and networks from complex state sponsored attackers. </p>
          <p>First of all, in the next few years, due to the further strengthening of the role of information warfare in military decision-making and operations, cybersecurity becomes an important means to protect state secrets and sensitive information. Second, Forbes insight 1 conducted a redesigned survey on information security in the era of digital transformation in 2017. According to the report, 69% of senior executives think that digital transformation makes them reconsider cybersecurity policy (Li, Ning; Ash, Ivan; Anwar, 2019). Which means in the next few years, information security managers and cybersecurity engineers need to develop a perfect information system security policy (ISSP) to protect the company's confidential information, assets, data and other important information. </p>
          <p>With the wide use of Internet technology, radio frequency identification technology, wireless broadband technology and other new technologies, there is a new possibility: many information technologies can be used secretly, so that powerful hackers can repeatedly invade the opponent's computer network, illegally control, interfere with, interrupt the user's system, illegally collect, store, process and use relevant information. On the system of network information security, this is based on the communication protocol, operating system, database for information maintenance, control, detection. The core part is not allowed to be accessed or modified at will. </p>
          <h3>What is the likely impact?</h3>
          <p>The potential factors affecting the development of cybersecurity mainly include the following aspects: (1) network structure factors: LAN, intranet and extranet. In the construction of internal network, in order to achieve the requirements of network openness, it is often necessary to give up part of the security mechanism. （2) Network protocol factor: the general Internet companies have higher and higher requirements for the compatibility of network protocols, so that the protocols between companies can be interconnected, compatible and communicate. While bringing benefits to the company, it also brings certain security risks. （3) Regional factors.（4) User factor: with the increase of users, there may be some business spies or hackers. （5) Host factor: in order to make LAN and single machine interconnected, the types of host are increased, such as workstation and server. Their network system and operating system are very different, and the loopholes brought by the system may cause greater security risks. </p>
          <p>As a result of the above factors may bring the following changes: (1) strengthen cybersecurity: comprehensive development of cybersecurity strategy, the use of firewalls, recording activities and so on. (2) Protection of application security: mainly for specific applications (such as web server, network payment software system) established by the security measures. （3) Protection of system security: it refers to the security protection from the perspective of the overall e-commerce system or network payment system. （4) New encryption technologies are produced: symmetric encryption and asymmetric encryption. </p>
          <p>Cybersecurity engineers, hackers, data companies (for example, cloud service providers: Amazon, etc.), mobile communications and other industries have an impact. For network engineers, future cybersecurity solutions will continue to increase to prevent and combat advanced and complex threats created by professional competitors. It will be an endless war.</p>
          <p>For hackers, although the number of blackmail threats detected has decreased, trend technology has found that the number of new blackmail software series has increased by 36% compared with the same period last year (Watkins, Ashly, 2020). So what network engineers need is reflection and learning </p>
          <p>For network engineers, more consideration should be given to physical security, network structure, system security and application system security. Do more research in the above four aspects to avoid information theft and loopholes. The enterprise is responsible for risk management, management is one of the most important parts of the network, must have a deep understanding of the network and can provide direct solutions when problems arise. As cowid-19 clearly points out, organizations need to be resilient to cybercriminals, and the skill gap has never been so obvious. This gap will not narrow soon, but the best way to solve this problem in the cybersecurity team is to improve skills, train and cultivate young professionals with the passion and initiative needed for the role (Watkins, Ashly, 2020). </p>
          <p>With the development of cybersecurity technology, there is a certain possibility that there will be new jobs and technologies. With the development of technology, it will also affect some of the past occupations. We must make changes. </p>
          <h3>How will this affect you?</h3>
          <p>For ordinary people's daily life, with the development of cybersecurity, more and more mobile payment software will appear, which will bring more convenience to people's life. Enterprises will also get a more perfect, comprehensive and secure cybersecurity system, which will provide the public with more secure and private assets, data and privacy protection. With the security needs of the Internet of things, cybersecurity will also need most of the talents to improve the security of the Internet of things. The development of cybersecurity provides a new, more inclusive and unified definition of cybersecurity. Cybersecurity needs solid basic knowledge of computer, network and mathematics. Therefore, it is very difficult to learn cybersecurity. Network engineers believe that this will strengthen and enrich the attention to interdisciplinary dialectics of cybersecurity, thus affecting the methods of researchers, funding institutions and organizations to deal with the challenges of cybersecurity (Craigen, Dan; Diakun-Thibault, Nadia; Purse, Randy, 2014). </p>
          <p>The development of cybersecurity will open the door to more understanding and cooperation to solve the increasingly serious and complex threats faced by cyberspace and the systems supporting cyberspace (Craigen, Dan; Diakun-Thibault, Nadia; Purse, Randy, 2014). With the frequent occurrence of industrial information security incidents and the implementation of policy standards, simple industrial information security protection products have been unable to meet the needs of industrial enterprise users. At the same time, because industrial enterprises generally lack the ability to implement industrial information security protection strategies, the demand for security system design and planning services arises at the historic moment. This provides a new job for students of computer network. Li Ning and He Wu point out that “Future research needs to develop measures to compare the results of actual cybersecurity action and self-reported cybersecurity behaviour.” Manufacturing enterprises have accelerated the pace towards "digitization" and "intelligence", and emerging technologies such as cloud computing, big data, 5g and artificial intelligence are emerging. </p>
          <h3>Blockchain and cryptocurrencies</h3>
          <h3>What does it do?</h3>
          <p>Generally speaking, blockchain is a kind of shared database, in which the data and information stored have the following characteristics: (1) unforgeability, (2) traceability, (3) collective maintenance, (4) trace in the whole process, (5) openness and transparency, etc. Based on the above characteristics, blockchain has a certain trust foundation and cooperation conditions, and has great development prospects. Blockchain is an intelligent peer-to-peer network that uses distributed database to identify, disseminate and record information, also known as value Internet. Cryptocurrency is a kind of transaction medium based on cryptography to ensure secure transaction and control transaction unit. Cryptocurrency is a kind of virtual currency. In 2009, bitcoin became the first decentralized cryptocurrency. </p>
          <p>Blockchain is a distributed data storage, consensus mechanism, encryption algorithm, point-to-point transmission and other computer science application mode. Therefore, blockchain is an important concept of cryptocurrency, such as bitcoin, Ethereum, etc. In terms of total market value, the total value of bitcoin alone has recently exceeded US $40 billion, and even Ethereum, the second most popular blockchain based cryptocurrency, is worth more than US $21 billion (Coinmarketcap, 2017; Woodside, J, Augustine, F, 2017). Blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies currently include: (1) distributed ledger. Transaction bookkeeping is completed by multiple nodes distributed in different places, so they can guarantee the legitimacy of transactions and testify for them. （2) Asymmetric encryption is highly encrypted for the account identity information, while the transaction information stored in the blockchain is public. Only with the permission of data possession can the data be encrypted and accessed, thus ensuring the data security and user privacy. （3) There are four different consensus mechanisms for blockchain, which are suitable for different conditions, so as to achieve high efficiency and high security. How to reach a consensus between accounting nodes to determine the validity of a record is not only a means of identification, but also a means of preventing tampering. （4) Smart contract, which is based on some creditable and unchangeable data, comes from the automated execution of some of the already drafted terms. From the perspective of data management, it can effectively provide the ability of risk management and control. </p>
          <p>Blockchain and cryptocurrency have created many digital currencies, and bitcoin is still the mainstream in the market. On March 23, 2021, bitcoin rose by about 6% in 24 hours, standing at US $60000 / piece, with a market value of about US $1.1 trillion. Secondly, Ethereum, Kia coin and so on. Bitcoin is the most well-known cryptocurrency, a digital asset used as currency, which relies on blockchain (decentralized online ledger, used to track and verify ownership to verify transactions) (Kirkus Reviews; Austin, 2020). Blockchain and cryptocurrency at present, blockchain has great potential application value in international exchange, letter of credit, equity registration, stock exchange and other financial fields. The point-to-point transaction can be realized through blockchain technology, avoiding the intervention of the third party. For example, visa launched visa B2B connect based on blockchain technology. Secondly, blockchain technology also plays an important role in the field of public services. The decentralized fully distributed DNS service provided by blockchain can realize the query and resolution of domain names through the point-to-point data transmission service between various nodes in the network, and can monitor the status and integrity of software. Finally, blockchain and cryptocurrency also play a certain role in the field of Internet of things and logistics. Through blockchain, we can reduce logistics costs, trace the production and transportation process of goods, and improve the efficiency of supply chain management. This field is considered as a promising application direction of blockchain. </p>
          <p>Blockchain is still in the stage of laboratory development and needs breakthrough progress. There is no mature application software for blockchain and cryptocurrency technology, which is quite different from Internet technology. Because the blockchain needs to carry all the information generated before replication, the amount of information in the next block is larger than that in the previous block, and the block capacity problem also needs to be solved. In the next few years, there is also an opportunity to apply the blockchain technology to the field of communication engineering. The philosophy and motivation of cryptocurrency founders and early participants shape the way technology is used and will be used, that is, blockchain can destroy today's technology risks in the form of monopoly and data abuse by some large companies (Kirkus Reviews; Austin, 2020). Through the way of information transmission, the information will be transmitted to all people, but only the person with a specific key can unlock it and obtain the information, which greatly ensures the security of the information. Quantum communication can also do this, competing with blockchain technology. Blockchain + big data solution makes use of the integration ability of big data to make the expansion of Internet of things basic users more directional, which is convenient to realize user expansion among the scattered users of intelligent logistics. With the development of blockchain technology and cryptocurrency, it plays an important role in the fields of communication, finance, insurance and public welfare. </p>
          <h3>What is the likely impact?</h3>
          <p>Nowadays, most people who have heard of bitcoin know blockchain, not just mining. Generally speaking, the development of blockchain and cryptocurrency mostly affects finance. Bitcoin is the first blockchain based plan. Like other cryptocurrencies, bitcoin also focuses on improving transaction efficiency, transparency, security, integrity, anonymity and cost reduction. In terms of blockchain, experts believe that it is time for real-time business. Justin sun from Tron believes that there will be many new businesses that utilize different blockchain models. It is worth noting that the implementation of blockchain technology will have a huge impact on the accounting industry by automating many manual processes that constitute most of the accounting standards (Woodside, J, Augustine, F, Giberson, Will, 2017). Secondly, blockchain and cryptocurrency will also have a certain impact on the logistics industry (supply chain). For example, there are tools based on blockchain to verify the identity of goods, and teams track and analyze customer behavior. These solutions effectively improve the automatic tracking function in logistics, and can reduce the complex data files in the tracking and traceability problem. With blockchain, companies can record their transactions directly into a joint register, thus creating a chain of accounting records (Woodside, J, Augustine, F, Giberson, Will, 2017). No one can predict how blockchain and encryption will be used in a year or two, but many new projects are emerging in various industries. One thing is right: if you are keen on innovation, consider implementing blockchain based functionality in your enterprise immediately. </p>
          <p>The technical characteristics of cryptocurrency show that the currency has portability, durability, divisibility and security (Moosa, Naazneen, 2019). Blockchain and cryptocurrency will have a great impact on computer hardware manufacturers, especially graphics card manufacturers. The demand of global game players for graphics cards can no longer catch up with the price of graphics cards. Most of the graphics cards have been purchased by "miners" for "mining", which has doubled the price of video cards. Some of them have risen to more than 2-3 times of the initial price. Forced graphics card manufacturers to announce the sale of mining graphics card to meet market demand. For example, NVIDIA has begun to vigorously deploy its mining graphics card business, and its latest CMP HX Series graphics card is about to be fully launched. Although cryptocurrency has increased in recent years, its value has been fluctuating from the beginning. Therefore, the value of cryptocurrency depends on purchasing power and adoption rate, while fiat money depends on the acceptance and trust of the central bank (Moosa, Naazneen, 2019). </p>
          <h3>How will this affect you?</h3>
          <p>With the development of blockchain technology and cryptocurrency technology, more and more people are involved in the virtual currency "mining" industry, which makes the cost of computer DIY higher and higher, making the game graphics card not a simple consumer product, but a disguised "financial product", and the loss of players by major electronics manufacturers is becoming more and more, A series of mine cards are gradually emerging in the industry. For ordinary people, the price of computer hardware has increased significantly, and the market demand has increased significantly. However, due to the emergence of new coronavirus, the output has declined to a certain extent, so that the price of computer hardware has doubled, and the interests of DIY players have been violated. NVIDIA tried to restrict or prohibit the mining function of the game graphics card by updating the driver, but it was sued by a large number of "miners", which cracked the mining function of the graphics card in the next few versions. At the same time, there is a different idea. People with graphics cards can consider buying them. As long as they are not just needed for work, they can sell them. If there is a mining accident one day, or Ethereum has a special miner, the graphics card market will collapse directly. The injured people are also the users who have bought the graphics cards. After all, the miners have already made enough money. This is really a promising idea. After all, the price of graphics card has gone up to a very outrageous level. In the second quarter of 2017, the price of bitcoin increased by more than 2.5 times, the price of Ethereum increased by more than 8 times, and the valuation of bitcoin and Ethereum reached a record level. However, Ethereum also experienced a one-day flash crash of - 20.9% in June 2017, with a weekly decline of nearly - 40% in June (Cheng, 2017, Woodside, J, Augustine, F, Giberson, Will, 2017). </p>
          <h3>Autonomous vehicles</h3>
          <h3>What does it do?</h3>
          <p>Autonomous vehicle is a kind of unmanned smart car which is realized by computer system. It can sense the environment and run in an unattended situation.There is no need for human passengers to control the vehicle at any time, nor for human passengers to appear in the vehicle at all.It has decades of history in the 20th century and shows a trend towards practicality at the beginning of the 21st century.Auto-driving automobiles rely on collaboration of artificial intelligence, visual computing, radar, surveillance devices and global positioning systems to enable computers to automatically and safely operate automobiles without any human initiative(Synopsys).</p>
          <p>The Association of Automotive Engineers currently defines six levels of driving automation, ranging from 0 (fully manual) to 5 (fully automatic), which are adopted by the United States Department of Transportation. The realization of automatic driving is a gradual process. At present, the international standard of automatic driving can be divided into five levels according to the degree of automatic driving. Automated cars are being tested in many parts of the world, but they are not yet available to the public.In fact, it will take many years, and the challenges range from technology and legislation to the environment and philosophy, which are unknown(Synopsys). In 2021, the scale and commercialization of autopilot became faster, but the fourth level of dependence was not enough to represent the mature autopilot system. At present, the technology and business model are becoming more and more mature in the second level to the third level. A large number of car companies are no longer keen on the fourth or higher level of automatic driving, but focus on the third level of auxiliary driving, which is a very safe strategy.</p>
              <p>In real life, there are brand cars equipped with automatic driving functions such as adaptive cruise and lane departure. As early as 2010, Audi and Stanford University cooperated with Volkswagen Group Research Laboratory to build a self driving car. The car is equipped with radar sensors and other sensing equipment, and has a large number of driving assistance systems. It is worth mentioning that at present, most Audi vehicles have the functions of adaptive cruise and lane departure assistance, and can even realize driverless on normal roads(Driving Professor, 2015).</p>
              <p>First of all, in the next few years of automatic driving, high-level automatic driving technology will be the first to realize commercialization. For example, in some single driving environment areas, the traffic situation is simple, and few or only a few external vehicles and pedestrians can enter. For example: airports, parks and ports. The limited scene has three characteristics: the number of vehicles and pedestrians is small, the vehicle speed is low, and the scene has geographical constraints. At present, some technology enterprises are developing the solution of automatic driving in this scene. At present, the world's first license for the automatic valet parking system comes from Germany. In July 2019, the automatic valet parking system will be used in the parking lot of Mercedes Benz Museum(Jianming Wu, 2020). Automatic valet parking system will gradually become popular and open to the public.</p>
              <p>In addition, auto companies will pay more attention to the possibility of mass production. In the future, we will be committed to mass production of part of the third level automatic driving technology with the help of the latter core technology of artificial intelligence. In the face of automatic driving technology, car companies have experienced a psychological process from mistrust to gradual attention. Until now, the major car companies in the market have a layout in this field. BAIC Motor Co., Ltd. of China said that it is comprehensively promoting the large-scale mass production application of the second level intelligent driving, and will realize the large-scale mass production of the third level only driving by 2022. Traffic Jam Pilot and Highway Pilot have become two common research and development directions of the third level automatic driving, which will also become the research and development focus of automobile enterprises in the next three years.</p>
              <h3>What is the likely impact?</h3>
              <p>With the development of Autonomous vehicles, there are several potential impacts. First, the transformation of the economy. The use of autopilot in business and consumer life has a certain impact on the economy. The BCG research team predicts that by the year 2035, 12 million fully automatic driving cars and 18 million partially automatic driving cars will be sold worldwide. The auto driving function will occupy 25% of the new car market, and the market will grow between 42 billion and 77 billion dollars. The second is driving safety. It is predicted that driverless vehicles will reduce the number of traffic accidents and deaths. In 2015, 35092 people lost their lives in car accidents on American roads. Car accidents also have a significant impact on the U.S. economy, with an estimated annual loss of $871 billion. A recent study by McKinsey Company found that autopilot and advanced driver assistance system could reduce the number of motor vehicle deaths by 90%, and save about 190 billion dollars in health care costs per year(OHIO University, 2020). </p>
              <p>Compared with the internal combustion engine vehicle, the self driving electric vehicle has longer service life and lower maintenance cost. Every family can save a lot of transportation costs, and some taxi drivers, truck drivers, internal combustion engine car manufacturing and oil production workers may lose their jobs. So there will be some changes: mobility for the elderly and the disabled will increase. The number of cars and trucks needed to be produced each year is reduced by 70%. The oil industry will suffer a severe recession. Air pollution and greenhouse gases are almost eliminated in the transportation industry(AccessScience, 2017). Therefore, the driverless self driving vehicle can be replaced by the current public transport driver's single person's work. If the automatic driving vehicle is used for commercial truck fleet, taxi service and school, it may replace the human driver(OHIO University, 2020).</p>
              <h3>How will this affect you?</h3>
              <p>In my daily life, autonomous vehicles can be used more. Most families park their cars for a long time. Because the driverless car does not need to be used in a fixed position during my study time, it can carry people with different plans and purposes on the same route. It can take me to work and take my family to another place. If you choose to share your car plan with others who travel on the same route, the cost of commuting will also be greatly reduced. It will maximize the role of the vehicle itself, rather than being parked in the garage because there is no driver. As car ownership per household decreases, our green space will increase and allow the construction of more facilities, such as hospitals and schools. Street planning will also change dramatically. Developers need to rethink the layout of the house, and the parking system may also change. As far as we know, there may not even be a need for human elevators and lighting, or even parking spaces.</p>
              <p>This intelligent technology can not only reduce emissions, because these self driving cars are likely to be electric vehicles, which do not pollute the air with carbon dioxide and other exhaust gases, and can also reduce idle time, because traffic congestion may also decrease and car ownership is also reduced. It will also give us a different view of the way we commute. Some self driving cars are electric cars, so the parking spaces in front of my house have a charging pile, which can be recharged at home without having to go to the gas station, which will also save us commuting expenses. Finally, in long-distance travel, driverless vehicles can eliminate most of the accidents. Through intelligent systems such as radar, laser, GPS, computer vision and embedded space to master language, it can safely drive past faulty vehicles, change lanes and speed vehicles to adjust traffic volume, which are more effective and safe than our driving(Emerald PUBLISHING, 2020).</p>
              <h3>Robot</h3>
              <h3>What does it do?</h3>
              <p>Robot technology, design, construct, and use robots to perform traditional tasks. Robots are widely used in automotive manufacturing and other industries to perform simple repetitive tasks and industries that must work in harmful environments. Many aspects of robotics involve artificial intelligence; robots may have the same feeling as humans, such as vision, touch, and the ability to sense temperature. Some can even make simple decisions, and current robotics research aims to design robots with a certain degree of self-sufficiency, thus allowing mobile and decision-making environments in unstructured environments. Industrial robots today are different from humans. Human form robots are called android.（Barbara A，2021）</p>
              <p>Robots were originally used to deal with monotonous tasks (such as making cars on assembly lines), but later were far beyond their original use.Mechanical bots come in all shapes and sizes to efficiently carry out the task for which they are designed. All robots vary in design, functionality and degree of autonomy. From the 0.2 millimeter-long “RoboBee” to the 200 meter-long robotic shipping vessel “Vindskip,” robots are emerging to carry out tasks that humans simply can’t. Generally, there are five types of robots:</p>
              <h4>1. Pre-Programmed Robots</h4>
              <p>Pre-programmed robots operate in a controlled environment where they do simple, monotonous tasks.And its job is to perform that task longer, faster and more efficiently than a human.</p>
              <h4>2. Humanoid Robots</h4>
              <p>Humanoid robots are robots that look like and/or mimic human behavior. These robots usually perform human-like activities (like running, jumping and carrying objects), and are sometimes designed to look like us, even having human faces and expressions. Two of the most prominent examples of humanoid robots are Hanson Robotics’ Sophia (in the video above) and Boston Dynamics’ Atlas.</p>
              <h4>3. Autonomous Robots</h4>
              <p>Autonomous robots operate independently of human operators. These robots are usually designed to carry out tasks in open environments that do not require human supervision. They are quite unique because they use sensors to perceive the world around them, and then employ decision-making structures (usually a computer) to take the optimal next step based on their data and mission. An example of an autonomous robot would be the Roomba vacuum cleaner, which uses sensors to roam freely throughout a home.</p>
              <h4>4. Teleoperated Robots</h4>
              <p>Teleoperated robots are semi-autonomous bots that use a wireless network to enable human control from a safe distance. These robots usually work in extreme geographical conditions, weather, circumstances, etc. Examples of teleoperated robots are the human-controlled submarines used to fix underwater pipe leaks during the BP oil spill or drones used to detect landmines on a battlefield.</p>
              <h4>5. Augmenting Robots</h4>
              <p>Augmenting robots either enhance current human capabilities or replace the capabilities a human may have lost. The field of robotics for human augmentation is a field where science fiction could become reality very soon, with bots that have the ability to redefine the definition of humanity by making humans faster and stronger. Some examples of current augmenting robots are robotic prosthetic limbs or exoskeletons used to lift hefty weights.（Builtin，2021）</p>
              <p>In the future, it must be the era of robots, and robots will become easier to communicate, more independent, more efficient and more intelligent. They will liberate people's busy hands, just as computers liberated people's computing.
                  But robots can also make many workers lose their jobs. In the next few years, the leading enterprises in the field of robotics have increased R & D efforts, focused on industrial Internet applications and intelligent factory solutions, attached importance to the R & D of unmanned vehicles, humanoid robots, post disaster rescue robots, deep-sea mining robots and other products, continuously innovated product forms, optimized product performance, and seized the first opportunity in the development of robot intelligent applications.（Mike，2020）</p>
              <p>Artificial intelligence technology can simulate the information process of human consciousness and thinking. Artificial intelligence is not human intelligence, but it can think like human and may surpass human intelligence. This is the technology of robotics, which makes all kinds of robots possible.</p>
              <h3>What is ths likely impact?</h3>
              <p>The future application scope of robots is the wide first . For robots operating in dangerous and bad environment : such as robots used for anti - terrorism and riot prevention , fire control , high voltage electricity , high - altitude industry , etc .Second , robots that repeat labor , such as sweeping robots and sweeping robots , will be more mature and more popular .</p>
              <p>With the development of robots, many people are unemployed. Robots don't make mistakes, they don't get tired, they don't need rest, they don't need wages. This can completely replace many occupations, such as workers, drivers and so on. So when a large number of robots enter the factory to produce instead of human beings, the workers will lose their jobs, and when the workers lose their jobs, they will lose their income. Without income, they will lose their purchasing power, and thus their ability to survive in the society.</p>
              <p>Therefore, the popularization of robots and the battle for elites will lead to monopoly and polarization between the rich and the poor. For example, workers, warehouse workers with repetitive labor, manufacturing workers and construction workers, are easy and have been replaced by robots. Many factories no longer employ workers, but implement a complete set of robot assembly line, which is faster and more accurate. Although it can not be said to replace a certain position, it plays a great auxiliary role, which is a development trend that can not be ignored in the era of artificial intelligence.</p>
              <h3>How will this affect you?</h3>
              <p>The popularity of robots has a great impact on people: it liberates people from the heavy and monotonous labor, and reflects the humanistic care. Robots can also help people do things beyond human power, such as in clean environment, vacuum environment, underwater operation and space operation. The application of robots will also create new jobs. Nowadays, all walks of life depend on robots. The popularity of robotics has affected me and many people around me. Robots have quietly entered our families. For example, the emergence of floor sweeping robots is an example. The emergence of floor sweeping robots can greatly simplify the time and labor force for us to do housework. At the same time, we can spare time to do other meaningful things. In the past, we spent a lot of time and energy on doing housework and sweeping the floor alone, which made us exhausted. Now we just need to connect to the Internet, move our fingers, and even turn it into automatic mode, Let him start cleaning regularly every day. Nowadays, many restaurants are served by robots. They are less than half a person high and serve fast and accurately. No attention is not focused on the wrong dishes, greatly improving the operational efficiency of the restaurant.</p>
              <p>Robots bring us a lot of convenience in life, but some people may become particularly lazy. Because many things don't need to be done by themselves, they are all done by robots. In the long run, people may lose their hands-on ability. This question is worth pondering. Artificial intelligence can help people well, but it also has some potential disadvantages. The key is how people use them.</p>

              <h2>Project Idea</h2>
          </div>
          <div class="extra_wrapper">
          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p>The project is building an application, a combination of a low-code development platform and a user communication community. Users can not only perform low-code development on the application, but also communicate with other users in the application community. Unlike traditional program development, the process of writing code in low-code development is somewhat similar to playing Lego blocks. Each functional module is like a Lego component. Different combinations can get programs with different functions. Reduce the difficulty of learning code and increase the interest of learners. The user can also further study the detailed code of each functional module. By clicking the icon of each functional module, the user can view the detailed code of each module. Users can also customize their own modules and upload their own modules or finished products to the community to share with other users. Not only that, the platform will also provide basic tutorials on low-code development and some exercises on low-code development.</p>
          <h3>Motivation</h3>
          <p>Today, people cannot do without smart devices and applications. Relatively speaking, the demand for learning programming is growing. The world will need more and more developers. In Europe alone, there will be more than 800,000 ICT job vacancies (Balanskat & Engelhard, 2015), and learning programming is a good direction. But in the process of developing programs, a considerable part of the programmer's work is repetitive and cumbersome, which also discourages many people who want to learn programming. And low-code development can solve this problem well. Speed is the biggest (and most obvious) benefit of the low-code approach. Using a low-code platform, developers can create new applications in hours or days instead of weeks or months (Stangarone 2016). Not only that, Stangarone (2016) mentioned that low-code development also has advantages such as increased IT productivity (without expanding the team) and reduced project failure rate. Low-code development can not only reduce the dependence on high-tech level, but also shorten the development time of the application. The development trend of low-code development is very optimistic. The low-code development platform market is expected to grow from USD 13.2 billion in 2020 to USD 45.5 billion in 2025, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of nearly 30% during the forecast period (reportlinker 2020). The demand for digitization and the maturity of agile DevOps practices are expected to increase the use of the low-code development platform market on a global scale.</p>
          <h3>Description</h3>
          <p>First of all, this is an application. There are computer and mobile terminals. Users can use computer programming at home or use mobile phone programming outside, because compared with traditional programming, low-code development does not need to enter letters or symbols, only drag Moving small components has a high fault tolerance rate, and users can accurately assemble the desired program using a mobile phone. Like most applications, users need to register and log in to use the function after opening. After registering and logging in, users can choose to learn low-code development or directly start low-code development. If users choose to start low-code development directly, users will enter the programming interface. Low-code refers to a development method, more specifically, a development platform, called "low-code development platform". Specifically, it refers to a development platform that can quickly generate applications without writing code or with a small amount of code. It is a method of application development through visualization, so developers with different levels of experience can use drag-and-drop components and model-driven logic to create web pages and mobile applications through a graphical user interface. Therefore, the compilation interface is different from other compilers, and is similar to the interface of drawing a flowchart. There are many icons with some functions in the toolbar to choose from, and each icon has a different meaning and code inside. Users can combine the order of the icons by themselves, or customize the icons and add them to the toolbar. If users choose to learn low-code development, they will enter the low-code development learning community. In the community, a lot of courses on low-code development are provided for users to learn. The function of the community is not only to learn low-code development, but to exchange low-code development. Experienced users can write their own teaching articles and upload them to the community, and can choose the reading conditions of this article, paid or free, to increase users' creative motivation. Regardless of whether it is a paid or free article, users can reward the author according to their preferences, which is undoubtedly a small surprise for the author. Of course, all content of all videos and articles must be checked by the platform, and non-compliant, illegal or irrelevant content must not be published. The platform will warn authors and ask them to make changes. If they do not modify after a few warnings, their account will be banned. Below each article, users can communicate through comments. If there is an interesting topic, users can also directly post a topic for discussion. Not only can articles be priced and uploaded, but applications and custom components developed in low code can also be uploaded and read for free or for a fee. Once a users is qualified, he or she can add it to his or her own repository for use or change. Similar to Repositories at GitHub, programs or components that are added to the repository also carry the author's tag, indicating who originally wrote the program or component. Moreover, there is also a very important feature, which is ignored by many applications, and that is user feedback. User feedback is very important, because the application is designed based on the designer's experience and ideas, and there must be a certain difference from the user's personal preferences. And if one of the functions of the application is different from the preferences of most users, it needs to be modified.</p>

              <li>Good communication skills. You are not the only member of the development team.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Many tutorials can be found on the Internet for programming language, database usage and app release process, and the required software can also be downloaded on the official website. You can buy the hardware equipment yourself or use the ones provided by the school. The ability to draw flowcharts and communicate can be cultivated in daily learning. Knowledge of low-code development can be found on the Internet. The development of the user interface and Nielsen's Law need to be understood slowly, and can be modified according to customer feedback every time the application is updated.</p>
          <h3>Outcome</h3>
          <p>If the project is successful, this will be a very complete low-code development tool. Because it is not only a development tool for low-code development, but also a community for developers to learn and exchange low-code knowledge. The user experience will be very good and will attract many developers and enthusiasts who plan to learn programming to use it. Those who are interested in low-code development can start their low-code development learning in the community, watch the teaching materials that come with the application or purchase teaching materials uploaded by other users, and directly use the application for low-code development. Developers who already have a certain low-code development foundation can exchange experiences in the community and upload their own courses or programs to earn pocket money. By using low-code development to learn programming and turning code development into a combination of modules, code learning becomes easier. Low-code development completely subverts the development model of existing software companies, makes it more efficient, greatly reduces the repetitive labor in the coding process, frees programmers from the heavy business development process, and invests in more critical cores Code development, so that the code output is more valuable.</p>

              <h3>Miao Zheng</h3>
              <p>It's great that the team's work has been going as planned. But at the same time, we have encountered some problems on git, and we still need experience to work together on GitHub. Through this assignment, I learned more about web development. </p>
              <h3>Fengke Zhan</h3>
              <p>We divided the work into many parts and we take our parts. But we still need more skills like developing a website. Websites of some groups are pretty, we should learn from them. A big project will finish very soon if we work together is what surprising me. Working together can make things easier. </p>
              <h3>Hao Gu</h3>
              <p>In my group, I am in the position of "Industry Data" staff. I need to collect all group members' ideal jobs, and find out the job skills to match the graphics and retrieve the data. About my computer controlling need to be improved, cause high level control system could reduce much time. And one thing made me surprising that IT Markets need so many experts in many fields learned from my team is that people work together makes wonderful outcomes.</p>
              <h3>Zhihong Deng</h3>
              <p>I wrote the project idea very smoothly, and it looks good overall, but it definitely lacks some details because I am not proficient in low-code development. At first, I thought the 1500 word project idea was very difficult, but in the end it was finished. The use of GitHub is also very successful. We entered the same group and had discussions about the web. After completing this task, I realized that the assignment of tasks in the team is very important. At the beginning, we had no clue when facing this task, but after the division of labor, everything became simple. </p>
              <h3>Shiqiao Xing</h3>
              <p></p>
              <h3>XInwei Li</h3>
              <p>I'm very lucky to be part of this team, and everyone's work is going well throughout the program. In fact, the communication between team members can be more frequent. Other aspects are very good. To my surprise, the team members' project work is progressing rapidly. In the group, I learned that there should be more team interaction, so as to get the central idea of the team, so as to develop cooperation. About git hub, members have joined the same group and have some discussions in web programming to expand the cooperation among members. </p>
